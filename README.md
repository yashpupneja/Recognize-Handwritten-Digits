# Recognize-Handwritten-Digits
This projects is based on building nueral networks to recognize handwritten digits with tensorflow. Using tensorflow, an open source library developed by Google Brain labs for deep learning research , you will take hand - drawn images of the nnumbers and build and train a nueral network to recognize and predict the correct label for the digit displayed.
# Steps to Build for Creating the project:
Step 1 : Configring the project - Installing the necessary packages:
                                 numpy==1.14.3
                                 tensorflow==1.4.0
                                 virtual environment using command: 
                                 python3 -m venv filename
                                 
 Step 2 : Importing the MNIST Dataset - The dataset MNIST is a classic in the machine learning community. This dataset is made up of images of handwritten digits 28 * 28 pixels in size. 
 
 Step 3 : Defining the Neural Network Architecture 
 
 Step 4 : Building the tensorflow graph 
 
 Step 5 : Training and Testing
